Overall, I would for sure come back with a bunch of friends, but definitely not for a date. Also, would like to try things besides the sushi because they seemed pretty interesting. For sushi, had a very good price point. Point of note: make sure to understand what is in the crab rolls before ordering because some are imitation crab and some are real crab.',
